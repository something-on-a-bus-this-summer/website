			As part of our fundraising efforts, we're offering a collection of sponsorship packages for interested companies and organisations. As a sponsor, you'll be helping bring over 2,000 makers across the nation together and, as part of that, have an opportunity to connect with them and get the word about what you're making.
		</p>
		<p>
			Here are our standard sponsorship packages:
		</p>
		<p>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<th>Tier</th>
					<th>Associated Benefits</th>

				<tr>
					<td>Gold ($15,000+)</td>
					<td>
						<ul>
							<li>A one to two minute message at the start of every event.</li>
							<li>Multiple "Featured" posts on our social media.</li>
							<li>For a negotiable additional amount, have the event co-branded as "Present by X".</li>
						</ul>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Silver ($10,000+)</td>
					<td>
						<ul>
							<li>Hand out flyers and swag to attending makers.</li>
							<li>Include a two to three sentence in our pre-event emails.</li>
						</ul>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Bronze ($5,000+)</td>
					<td>
						<ul>
							<li>Your logo will be on our website, the converted minibus, and our social medias.</li>

					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
